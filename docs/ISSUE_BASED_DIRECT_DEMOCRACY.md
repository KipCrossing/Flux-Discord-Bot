# Issue Based Direct Democracy

Issue Based Direct Democracy (IBDD) is a system of Direct Democracy that builds upon traditional Direct Democracy by implementing a combination of both Liquid Democracy and Vote Swapping Democracy.

## Liquid Democracy

Liquid Democracy is a system of Democracy that allows it's voters to either vote directly on issues or designate another voter to vote on their behalf. Voters may revert back to voting for themselves or change who they designate at any time. Chains may be formed when someone has been designated and decided to designate another voter. For instance Voter A can designate Voter B and Voter B can designate voter C; allowing Voter C to vote on behalf Voter B and Voter A.

## Vote Swapping Democracy

Vote Swapping Democracy is a system of Democracy that allows it's voters to swap votes with other voters on a different issue. For instance, if there were two issues, Issue A and Issue B, a voter could trade their vote on Issue A to gain more influence over Issue B. The types of Vote Swapping Democracy can be practically infinite as the mechanism at which votes are swapped may vary. In general, votes can be swapped directly (1 for 1) or via some sort of credit, to overcome the [Coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants) problem.
